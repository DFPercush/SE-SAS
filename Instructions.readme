Setup:
If you want to use a cockpit besides the main one as the reference,
set 'DefaultControlBlock' below. Or use the 'control' command to set.
Make sure your craft has some gyros, power, and enable forward/back
thrusters for station keeping. That's about it.

Update: While locked to any direction, you can still give roll commands
by using Q and E from the active cockpit or control block. This may
only work from that one cockpit.

Commands:

off / stop:          Halt program and turn off gyro overrides.

pro / prograde:      The direction your ship is moving. Forward.

retro / retrograde:  Facing backwards along your direction of movement.

norm / normal:       Perpendicular to the plane of your orbit.
                     If you are moving east, normal would be north.

anti / antinormal:   Opposite normal. If moving east, antinormal is south.

out:                 Radial out. Facing perpendicular to your orbit but
                     in the same plane. Basically, away from the planet.

in:                  Radial in. Towards the ground.

disp:                Display debugging information.

keep:                Maintains a certain min and max altitude.
    (no args)            Toggle on/off. Maintain the current orbit.
    [number]             Maintain a circular orbit of [number] height,
                         in meters, from the center of the planet.
    [max] [min]          Maintain an orbit of apogee [max] and perigee [min].
    on|off|toggle        Enable or disable this mode.

control [block]      Sets the active cockpit, remote control, or ship controller.
